# cyan-yellow-magenta

original facebook query:

"I'm not sure if this is a bug or user error so I'm noting it here. basically I want to get Pd working with cyan/yellow/magenta besides red/green/blue. but the patch I've got is kind of a dirty solution (bang floats from cyan into green/blue, yellow into red/green and magenta into red/blue - I use the change colour properties from the canvas help file). here the video shows exactly the issue (it is quite short), but I have the patch to refer to as well"
